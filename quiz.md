In this quiz, we will be using a retail dataset. You can get the CSV file stored within the folder under `retail.csv` file. The data has 9994 observations with 14 variables. 

Here is the list of the column description:
- `Order.ID`: Id of order.
- `Order.Date`: Order of Date.
- `Ship.Date`: Date of shipping.
- `Ship.Mode`: type of shipment.
- `Customer.ID`: Id of Customer.
- `Segment` : Customers segment.
- `Product.ID` : Id of Product.
- `Category` : has 3 levels "Furniture","Office Supplies","Technology"    
- `sub.category`: more spesific categories
- `Product.Name` : Name of product that were sold.
- `Sales` : How much earning of each sales.
- `Quantity` : Quantity item sold.
- `Discount` : How much Discount were given for each sales.
- `Profit` : How much gain company earn for each sales.


## Programming For Data Science

1. How many transactions generating above-average profit have a Quantity value of lesser than 5?
  - [ ] 1380
  - [ ] 1793
  - [ ] 2551
  - [ ] 758

2. Which customer segment has the most first-class shipment?
  - [ ] Consumer
  - [ ] Corporate
  - [ ] Home Office

3. Order the sub-categories in Office Supplies, based on the number of items sold taking into account the Quantity of each transaction.
  - [ ] Binder, Paper, Storage
  - [ ] Appliances, Art, Binder
  - [ ] Supplies, Envelopes, Fasteners
  - [ ] Paper, Binder, Art

## Practical Statistics

4. Which statistical measures can be used to understand the diversity of the data?
  - [ ] Probability
  - [ ] Mean
  - [ ] Standard Deviation
  - [ ] Correlation

5. The correlation between the cost of producing an item and the profit generated is **0.80**. Which of the following statements are true regarding the value of the correlation?
  - [ ] As the cost of production increase, the profit gained decreases
  - [ ] As the cost of production decreases, the profit gained decreases
  - [ ] As the cost of production increase, the profit are fixed

6. The company applies a promo to increase sales. After a month, you want to find out whether the promo has succeeded in increasing the profit or not with an average profit before the promo is 5000 and a standard deviation of 1000. After one month the promo is applied, it turns out the profit is 6000. Does this observation (5000) deviate away from the population enough for it to be statistically significant? Use a 95% confidence interval.

  - [ ] Fail to reject the null hypothesis, the promo does not have a statistically significant impact
  - [ ] Fail to reject the null hypothesis, the promo has a statistically significant impact
  - [ ] Reject the null hypothesis, the promo has a statistically significant impact 
  - [ ] Reject the null hypothesis, the promo does not have a statistically significant impact
